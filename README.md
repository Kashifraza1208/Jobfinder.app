# Project Demo - https://jobfinder-app.vercel.app/login

Project Summary:

Objective: Create a web portal with login/signup functionality, job search using the GitHub API, job details view, and application submission. Use Redux for state management and local/session storage for session maintenance.

# Feature

User authentication with minimal login/signup details.
Utilize local/session storage for user session management.
Landing page with an input for selecting a programming language.
Fetch job listings from the GitHub public API based on the chosen language.
Display a list of job postings with an option to view details.
Fetch detailed job information upon selection.
Create a separate page for viewing job details and submitting applications.
Application form includes fields for name, email, cover letter, and resume upload.
Show a success page after application submission with a preview of the application data.
Implement design, validations, and user interface rules as required.


# Tech Stack
Frontend: React for building the user interface.
State Management: Redux for managing application state.
Session Management: Local/session storage for maintaining user sessions.
API Integration: GitHub public API for job listings.
Styling: Implement design, validation, and UI rules for a cohesive user experience.
This project involves creating a web portal that allows users to search for programming jobs using the GitHub Jobs API, view job details, and submit applications. It emphasizes user authentication, state management using Redux, and local/session storage for session persistence. The application should provide a user-friendly interface with proper design, validation, and rules for a seamless user experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
